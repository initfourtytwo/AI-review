## Choosing the Right Model

* **Problem:** The market is flooded with open and closed-source models; ‚Äúbest‚Äù depends on context.
* **Approach:**

  * **Frontier models:** GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini ‚Äî best-in-class but paid and closed.
  * **Open-source models:** LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma, Qwen ‚Äî flexible, customizable, cost-efficient.
* **Selection strategy:**

  1. Identify your **task type** (e.g., reasoning, coding, summarization).
  2. Filter by **practical constraints** (latency, cost, memory).
  3. Compare candidates using **leaderboards and benchmarks**.
* **Mindset:** There is no universal ‚Äúbest‚Äù LLM ‚Äî only the right one for a defined goal.

## Model Leaderboards and Benchmarks

* **Resource:** **Hugging Face Open LM Leaderboard** ‚Äî central hub to evaluate open-source models.
* **Metrics included:** ARC, MMLU, Truthful QA, GSM8K, Winograd, and others for reasoning and knowledge tests.

## Technical vs Business Metrics

* **Two categories of evaluation:**

  1. **Model-centric (technical) metrics:** Used during development.

     * **Cross-entropy loss:** Measures prediction accuracy.

       * Computed as `‚àílog(probability of correct next token)`.
       * Lower = better.
     * **Perplexity (PPL):** `e^(cross-entropy loss)`; interprets model confidence.

       * 1 = perfect, 2 = 50 % accuracy, higher = worse.
  2. **Business-centric (outcome) metrics:** Used to evaluate real-world impact.

     * ROI, task efficiency, latency improvements, user satisfaction, etc.
* **Insight:**

  * Technical metrics guide **training**.
  * Business metrics validate **value** and **impact**.
  * Use both in concert for balanced evaluation.

## Key Takeaways

* **Model selection** = balancing capability, cost, latency, and control.
* **Leaderboards** ‚Üí objective comparison; **metrics** ‚Üí quantitative insight.
* **Loss + Perplexity** ‚Üí measure technical performance; **ROI/time gains** ‚Üí measure business success.
* **Frontier vs open-source** isn‚Äôt binary ‚Äî hybrid systems combine strengths.
* **Evaluation mindset:** Always link metrics back to business value.
